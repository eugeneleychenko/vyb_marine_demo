The Automotive XL is a durable, heavy-duty replacement V-belt designed for the most demanding engine drives. Due to thermal forces in the vehicle engine, this variable notched belt tightens on the drive as it heats up to prevent slippage or belt loss, improve belt performance, and reduce noise.

Fiber-loaded rubber stock adds flexibility along the length of the belt and provides greater lateral stability in the pulley. Form-ground to ensure precise top width and sidewall dimensional control for proper fit to the pulley. Thermally active tensile cords for maintenance-free performance when properly installed and tensioned. XL Belts resist oil, heat, ozone, weather, and aging for improved belt life. Meets or exceeds SAE J636C specifications.

The Automotive XL is a durable, heavy-duty replacement V-belt designed for the most demanding engine drives. Due to thermal forces in the vehicle engine, this variable notched belt tightens on the drive as it heats up to prevent slippage or belt loss, improve belt performance, and reduce noise.

Fiber-loaded rubber stock adds flexibility along the length of the belt and provides greater lateral stability in the pulley. Form-ground to ensure precise top width and sidewall dimensional control for proper fit to the pulley. Thermally active tensile cords for maintenance-free performance when properly installed and tensioned. XL Belts resist oil, heat, ozone, weather, and aging for improved belt life. Meets or exceeds SAE J636C specifications.

ENGINEERED TO REDUCE WATER INTRUSION - Corrosion is a leading cause in marine starter failures. Sierra’s new line of starters are engineered to minimize the opportunity for water to enter the system and prevent water accumulation. These preventitive measures increase the life of your starter and provide many years of reliable service.

IMPROVED SOLENOID DESIGN FOR MAXIMUM RELIABILITY - Many times, a weak battery can be the source of new starter malfunctions. Solenoids that require higher amperage can fail to start when the battery cannot deliver sufficient power. Our new high performance solenoid design and improved solenoid material spec allows for a lower pull in current compared to the competition which results in a more reliable starter in the case of a partially discharged battery.

IMPROVED HOUSING - In order to prevent water intrusion, Sierra’s new line of starters are designed to seal off the internal components from the extreme elements found in the marine environment.

DUCKBILL VALVE - Preventing corrosion is vital to the reliability of your starter. Should moisture find a way into the housing, Sierra has incorporated a one-way valve and relief cuts to remove moisture and prevent water accumulation.

PAINTED SURFACE - The starter housing is painted to prevent rust and corrosion on the exterior surface while keeping your starter looking like new after many years of service.","

Raw Water Pump Drive Belt fit Crusader Marine 270 HP engines.

The Automotive XL is a durable, heavy-duty replacement V-belt designed for the most demanding engine drives. Due to thermal forces in the vehicle engine, this variable notched belt tightens on the drive as it heats up to prevent slippage or belt loss, improve belt performance, and reduce noise.

Fiber-loaded rubber stock adds flexibility along the length of the belt and provides greater lateral stability in the pulley. Form-ground to ensure precise top width and sidewall dimensional control for proper fit to the pulley. Thermally active tensile cords for maintenance-free performance when properly installed and tensioned. XL Belts resist oil, heat, ozone, weather, and aging for improved belt life. Meets or exceeds SAE J636C specifications.
